# LIT-AlphaFold

## Description

LIT-AlphaFold is a modified version of AlphaFold developed in the [Laboratoire d'Innovation Thérapeutique](https://medchem.unistra.fr/)(LIT) at the University of Strasbourg.

LIT-AlphaFold combines features from [AlphaPulldown](https://github.com/KosinskiLab/AlphaPulldown) and [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold), while including additional tools for multistate modelling.

The templates and the multiple sequences alignement (MSA) used by AlphaFold for structure prediction can be modified to obtain different conformational state than the one predicted by default AlphaFold.

The pipeline is available for both local installation and online using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LIT-CCM-lab/LIT-AlphaFold/blob/main/LIT-AlphaFold-Colab.ipynb)

## Pre-installation

Before installing LIT-AlphaFold we advice to download AlphaFold's weights and the related genetic databases. To do so please follow the instructions in https://github.com/kalininalab/alphafold_non_docker.

LIT-AlphaFold **does not** require to download the genetic databases since it is configured to also use the *MMseqs2* webserver for MSA generation, as in ColabFold. 
The models' weights **must** be downloaded since LIT-AlphaFold has been developed to run calculations locally.

## Installation

**conda** is required to install LIT-AlphaFold. If *conda* is not already installed on your machine, or you are unfamiliar with its use, a user guide can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

1. Clone the LIT-AlphaFold repository and enter the directory.
```console
git clone https://github.com/LIT-CCM-lab/LIT-AlphaFold
cd LIT-AlphaFold
```

1. Create the conda environment from the *litaf_env.yaml* file.
```console
conda env create -f  litaf_env.yaml
conda activate lit-af
```
1. Install AlphaFold, ColabFold, and AlphaPulldown using pip. AlphaPulldown is installed without its dependencies to avoid conflicts with the different versions, some modules used for analysis might be missing, in case it is advised to install them manually via pip.
```console
pip install alphapulldown==0.40.4 --no-deps
pip install --no-warn-conflicts "colabfold[alphafold-minus-jax] @ git+https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold@v1.5.3"
pip install https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/cuda11/jaxlib-0.3.25+cuda11.cudnn82-cp310-cp310-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
pip install jax==0.3.25 chex==0.1.6 biopython==1.79
```
1. Install the *litaf* module
```console
pip install litaf/
```

## How to use
