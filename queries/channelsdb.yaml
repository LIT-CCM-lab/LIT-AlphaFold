# In the query it is necessary to indicate how the channel was identified, here as an example only the reviewed channels are used for the query
# The channel Type is not a mandatory field
# For all the properties it is possible to give an exact value to consider, by just giving the name of the property
# Or it is possible to set a lower and upper threshold by adding min_ and max_ before the name of the property respectively
